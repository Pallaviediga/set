                The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, is located in Amritsar, Punjab.
                It is the most sacred shrine of Sikhism.
                The temple was founded by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, in 1577.
                Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Guru, completed the construction and installed the Adi Granth (holy scripture).
                The temple is built in the middle of a sacred pool called Amrit Sarovar.
                Its upper floors are covered with pure gold, giving it the name “Golden Temple.”
                The architecture blends Hindu and Islamic styles, symbolizing unity and harmony.
                The temple has four entrances, showing that it is open to all people, regardless of religion or caste.
                The Golden Temple serves free meals (langar) to thousands of visitors daily.
                It is open 24 hours and maintained by volunteers and devotees.
                The peaceful atmosphere and divine music create a spiritual experience for all.
                The Golden Temple is not just a religious site, but a symbol of equality, peace, and compassion.
